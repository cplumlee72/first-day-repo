        <p>My name is Caleb, I am very excited to be here and learn alongside all of you! I'm born and raised in the DFW area of Texas, although I hope 
          to move to Colorado in the future. I am married with a baby girl, and am changing careers so that I can provide for them better. My hobbies 
          include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Powerlifting, and playing video games. I love playing League of Legends, Souls-like games, and Tactical War Simulators. 
          I love music, especially metal and hardstyle. I look forward to moving ahead.
